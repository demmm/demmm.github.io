  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;keyboard&lt;/em&gt; module had a regression in which it no-longer painted
the keycaps in the keyboard preview. (reported by Vinnie)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;plasmalnf&lt;/em&gt; module did not set all of the look-and-feel values
in the target system. (reported by Bluestar Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; module, warnings about the strength of the password
are now correctly pluralized when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; module, if ICU is installed, the user’s full name is
automatically transliterated to US-ASCII (for some locales; this will
need tweaking) so that the login name is acceptable. (Thanks Artem)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Calamares now sets the C++ standard for compilation to C++17; this
is for better compatibility and fewer warnings when building with
modern KDE Frameworks and KPMcore 4.2.0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vietnamese translations have been added. Welcome! (Thanks TTran)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;initcpiocfg&lt;/em&gt; module should support plymouth with encryption
now. (Thanks Matti)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;keyboard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;keyboardq&lt;/em&gt; modules now share backend code
and handle non-ASCII layouts better (for setting passwords
and usernames). (Thanks Artem)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various cleanups and documentation improvements in the &lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt;
module, and configurable GPT name for swap. (Thanks Gaël)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A long-standing bug related to GPT partition flags in the
&lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt; module has been resolved. #1327 #1267&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; module now has a more detailed way to specify
user groups – which may be system groups rather than user-GIDs.
A new option in each group can require that the group already
exists in the target system, allowing for better consistency checks
with the squashfs. #1523&lt;/li&gt;

but Calamares 3.2.31 is here.
This is a medium-cycle release with bugfixes, some new features,
and translation updates in the Calamares 3.2 series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that this was initially released from git revision
40aa0fcaba, and then re-tagged and re-rolled from one
revision later, 9ce08beead. The first release would not
build with KPMcore4; there are no other changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corentin Noël&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kadler15 (new contributor! hi!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;core&quot;&gt;Core&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the start of the &lt;em&gt;exec&lt;/em&gt; phase, an overview is given of the
various job weights, which allows you to tweak the overall
progress reporting during the installation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Problems with running Calamares on a 1-core single CPU have been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;keyboard&lt;/em&gt; module now recognizes Turkish “F” layout and
will set the vconsole keyboard layout correctly even if xkb
keymaps are not found.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;machineid&lt;/em&gt; module, which generates UUIDs for systemd and dbus
and can generate entropy files (filled from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/code&gt; in the host
system) now supports more than one entropy file; generate them as needed
(or copy a fixed value to all, depending on &lt;em&gt;entropy-copy&lt;/em&gt;). Deprecate
&lt;em&gt;entropy&lt;/em&gt; (which generates a specific output file) as too inflexible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt; module, swap can now be chosen as &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt;, which is
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; create a swap partition, but write a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/swapfile&lt;/code&gt; in the root
directory, 512MiB large, and set that as swap. There is as yet no
“smarts” about the size of the swap file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple problems in the &lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt; module around partition
sizing have been resolved by Corentin Noël.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;preservefiles&lt;/em&gt; module documentation did not match the functionality,
and when used, didn’t work right. #1521 (thanks kadler15)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress reporting from the &lt;em&gt;unpackfs&lt;/em&gt; module has been revamped:
it reports more often now, so that it is more obvious that files
are being transferred even when the percentage progress does not
change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;unpackfs&lt;/em&gt; module now supports a &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; setting for each
of the unpack entries. For a single entry this does not matter,
but if there are multiple entries it allows tweaking the relative
progress between each entry.&lt;/li&gt;

Do not expect much Calamares work during the conference.

  &lt;li&gt;Manzoor Ahmed Munawar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sai Kamal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Victor Ibragimov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release has two giant source-code changes that have no effect
on functionality, but do touch each and every source file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SPDX headers for licensing information, following the standard
set by REUSE.software ; all source files and resources have
SPDX-License-Identifier information and copyright notices. All
of the boilerplate texts have been removed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calamares coding style has been mechanically applied to the entire
codebase. This was already done to most of it, but there were
some hold-outs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;core&quot;&gt;Core&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network access status is deprecated in Qt 5.15’s QNetworkAccessManager,
and was not useful already in some previous versions. Replace its
use in the Calamares network service by testing-it-ourself directly
via a synchronous ping. (Thanks to Asif)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Telugu translation. (Thanks to Sai)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urdu translation started. (Thanks to Manzoor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Timezones translated in Tajik and Russian. (Thanks to Victor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;keyboardq&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;localeq&lt;/em&gt; improvements. (Thanks to Anke)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; module did not set up autologin properly. This is yet another
regression left over from 3.2.28. (Reported by Phil and pcrepix, #1498)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;welcome&lt;/em&gt; module now sets the &lt;em&gt;LANG&lt;/em&gt; key in the locale configuration
(which is shared with the &lt;em&gt;locale&lt;/em&gt; module and consumed by the
&lt;em&gt;localecfg&lt;/em&gt; module). This makes it feasible to drop the &lt;em&gt;locale&lt;/em&gt;
module and still set the installed system’s language to the language
selected in Calamares. (Reported by FerenOS)&lt;/li&gt;

while Calamares development continues inside. In previous
years there has been a “Calamares Summer Plan” so let’s continue
with that in spite of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past 15 releases or more, Calamares has tried to
do “short-cycle” releases: perhaps every other week,
although that often stretched out to a month as
landing-things and finishing-things is harder than it looks.
This model of short-cycle releases is set to continue
for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The short-cycle release model also brings “things land when they land”
with it: features get worked on, at varying speeds,
and are merged to the &lt;em&gt;calamares&lt;/em&gt; branch when they are ready.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recent releases were a very mixed bag, so there’s been a lot
more testing added recently to try to avoid that. Integration
testing, by the distro’s that use Calamares, remains essential though.
I’d like to particularly thank KaOS, Manjaro and neon for their
bug reports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most recently we’ve had a lot of internal changes that aren’t
immediately visible for the end-user: configuration files
have been cleaned up, new configuration options added, and 
the licensing of the whole codebase has been checked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upcoming releases will continue the work on QML modules, thanks
to KaOS, and user-interface improvements requested by various
downstream distro’s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New translations continue to come in, with Telugu now on the roster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tidying up partitioning remains a big issue, as does rootless operation
(which is also necessary for better accessibility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the plan is “steady as she goes” for the next quarter,
with the possibility of source-incompatible Calamares 3.3 branch
slowly growing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Your Name</name></author><summary type="html">COVID-19 continues to hold much of the world in its grip, while Calamares development continues inside.

One regression in user-group settings has been fixed (thanks to Asif for reporting it).
We’re now at
&lt;strong&gt;Calamares 3.2.29&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a somewhat regular features-and-fixes release in the
Calamares 3.2 series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asif Mahmud Shimon (new contributor! hi!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;core&quot;&gt;Core&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edge case in extracting string-lists from YAML, reported and fixed
by Asif (#1491).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Progress reporting is now more flexible. Modules can have a weight
assigned to them in the descriptor; module instances can have a weight
assigned which overrides the module descriptor. When jobs are run
for a module instance, the jobs report progress pro-rated by the
module’s weight. Or in other words, it is now possible to tweak
the amount of the overall progress bar that different modules fill.
The default settings give unpackfs a weight of 12. (#1176)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The debug window currently does not show the right job queue.
This will be fixed in an upcoming release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; module did not read the &lt;em&gt;defaultGroups&lt;/em&gt; correctly.
Fixed by the string-lists change mentioned above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
