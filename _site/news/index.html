The new swapfile support was causing occasional problems
on ArcoLinux, and this has been resolved by being smarter
about creating the swapfile. There is a handful of
bugfixes and some improved error-reporting.
Also, a new translation to Friulian has appeared. Benvignûts!
Some features originally planned for 3.2.32 have been bumped to the next

One regression in user-group settings has been fixed (thanks to Asif for reporting it).
