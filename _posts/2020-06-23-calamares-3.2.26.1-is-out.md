title: "Calamares 3.2.26.1 hotfix released"
---

The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is as
surprised as your are that it announces the
immediate availability of **Calamares 3.2.26.1**, a mostly-hotfix release.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

 - Anke Boersma
 - Gaël PORTAY

## Core ##
 - Welcome to Azerbaijani translations. These are available
   in two variations, *Azerbaijani* and *Azerbaijani (Azerbaijan)*.
   [Wikipedia Azerbaijani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_language#North_vs._South_Azerbaijani)
   has a nice overview.
 - Warnings while building with Qt 5.15 have been much reduced.

## Modules ##
 - *partitioning* has one case of undefined behavior (UB) due
   to a missing integer-initialization. (Thanks Gaël)
 - *keyboardq* QML module now works correctly. (Thanks Anke)
