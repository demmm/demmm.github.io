title: "Calamares Late Summer"
---


COVID-19 continues to hold much of the world in its grip,
while Calamares development continues inside. In previous
years there has been a "Calamares Summer Plan" so let's continue
with that in spite of everything.



- For the past 15 releases or more, Calamares has tried to
  do "short-cycle" releases: perhaps every other week,
  although that often stretched out to a month as
  landing-things and finishing-things is harder than it looks.
  This model of short-cycle releases is set to continue
  for the foreseeable future.
  
  The short-cycle release model also brings "things land when they land"
  with it: features get worked on, at varying speeds,
  and are merged to the *calamares* branch when they are ready.
- Recent releases were a very mixed bag, so there's been a lot
  more testing added recently to try to avoid that. Integration
  testing, by the distro's that use Calamares, remains essential though.
  I'd like to particularly thank KaOS, Manjaro and neon for their
  bug reports.
- Most recently we've had a lot of internal changes that aren't
  immediately visible for the end-user: configuration files
  have been cleaned up, new configuration options added, and 
  the licensing of the whole codebase has been checked.
- Upcoming releases will continue the work on QML modules, thanks
  to KaOS, and user-interface improvements requested by various
  downstream distro's.
- New translations continue to come in, with Telugu now on the roster.
- Tidying up partitioning remains a big issue, as does rootless operation
  (which is also necessary for better accessibility).
  
Overall, the plan is "steady as she goes" for the next quarter,
with the possibility of source-incompatible Calamares 3.3 branch
slowly growing.
