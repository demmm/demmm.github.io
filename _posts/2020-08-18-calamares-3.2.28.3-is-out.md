Third time is the charm. Thanks to careful bug reports from Marco Obaid,
on regressions in Calamares 3.2.28.1 and .2, we're now at
**Calamares 3.2.28.3**. This version fixes regressions in the previous release.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.
