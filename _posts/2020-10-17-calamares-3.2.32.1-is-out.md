title: "Calamares 3.2.32.1 released"
---

This is a quick-fix for a source-incompatibility between
Calamares 3.2.32 (released October 16th) and KPMcore 4.2.0
(released October 13th). Since KPMcore is **strongly** recommended
for regular use (although it does not matter much on a Live CD),
we did a new Calamares release for it.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

Besides the fix for KPMcore-compatibility, there are some minor translation
fixes and it is no longer possibly to continue the installation with
an empty login name.
